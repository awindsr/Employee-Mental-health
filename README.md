# GTA Sandshores: Employee-Mental-health

The Employee-Mental-Health project was initiated as a part of the GTA: Sandshores hackathon conducted by the Mulearn organisation in collaboration with Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM).

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop a working mobile application or web app that offers innovative solutions to combat stress, burnout, and mental and physical health issues in the corporate work environment. Participants are encouraged to propose ideas, technologies, and strategies that promote healthier work environments, support employee mental health, and enhance overall well-being and productivity.
# OUR SOLUTION:
We developed an all in one solution where we gamified the mental health data collection process. The data would then be processed and possible recommendations to maintain/improve the mental health of the employees will be displayed.

We plan to incentivise the process to encourage companies to adopt this measure. The top organisations with excellent average employee Mental Health Score will receive benefits and tax exemptions from the government. Additionally, tools and resources to educate companies and their employees will be distributed by governments.
